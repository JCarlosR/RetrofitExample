# Retrofit HTTP Requests Example

Steps to see how the information is recevied by the server:

1- Develop a backend server or use a service to inspect HTTP requests, like https://requestbin.com/

2- Replace the API base URL in `ApiService.kt` (there is a `BASE_URL` inside the `companion object`)

3- Run the app and click the buttons to see the difference between the requests generated by them

## Laravel backend

TODO: Create a Laravel project to get, validate and store this information.

At this moment, for the first 2 buttons you can use `$request->input('field_name')` to access the information.

And for the last one, the body raw content is accessible from `$request->getContent()`.
